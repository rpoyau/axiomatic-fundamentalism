This repository contains the *Axiomatic Fundamentalism (AF)* protocol, a strict logical discipline for conducting and reviewing traceable research.

It is a **"Focusing Station"** for methodology, designed to drain the "swamps" of imported postulates, hand-waving, and untraceable claims. The core philosophy is **"Less is More"**: a model is only as strong as its auditable, axiomatic foundation.

This protocol acts as a firewall, enforcing a "Vulcan-like" logic to keep the derivation clean. It is the system that allows you to keep your "foot on the gas" without driving into a wall of speculation.

## The Full Protocol

The complete guide, intended for authors and reviewers, is available in the repository:

[**`axiomatic-fundamentalism.pdf`**](./axiomatic-fundamentalism.pdf)

## The Core Commitments (AF)

The protocol is built on seven core commitments:

* **AF1. State axioms once, precisely.** Define symbols and scope. Do not defend them.
* **AF2. Derive with mathematics only.** Consequences must follow from axioms via mathematics, not by appeal to external laws.
* **AF3. Specialise by declaration, not by postulate.** All constraints are explicit modeling choices.
* **AF4. No midstream imports.** Never justify a step by invoking an external "law" or tacit empirical rule.
* **AF5. No retrofitting.** Do not alter axioms to force a target result.
* **AF6. Scope discipline.** Exclude edge cases beyond scope instead of speculating.
* **AF7. Traceability & falsifiability.** Each claim must link to its premises and admit concrete tests that could contradict it.

## The Relational Foundations (RF)

All AF-compliant models are relational.

* **RF1. Distinction precedes relation.** Relations are generated from declared distinctions.
* **RF2. Closure.** Within the model, nothing else exists. No distinction, no model entity.
* **RF3. No absolutes.** Undeclared "absolute properties" cannot enter derivations.
* **RF4. Information is bookkeeping, not a law.** Information-theoretic measures are constraints on the model, not physical postulates.
* **RF5. No elevation of limitations.** Do not promote modeling limitations (e.g., resolution) to universal laws.
